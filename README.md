# CPEN513_Project
Final project for CPEN513

The project can be run by typing <python3 tests.py>

This will run both the recursive bi-partitioning, as well as the k-way partitioning. The time taken, as well
as the final cost (measured in number of edge cuts) will be output. 

To change the input file, modify line 18 of tests.py. Similarily, the number of partitions can be modified on 
line 22. Unfortunately, the random seed needs to be manually modified manually on line 20.

To display the repective partitions output, lines 45 and 58 can be uncommented.
